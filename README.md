## Description

- What was your motivation? The concept of GraphQL was expressed to our class as a new technology that will gain popularity in the near future for it's faster ways to deal with routes when constructing a website. In this project, we are tasked with turning a RESTful website to use GraphQL instead.

## Usage

This website allows the user to create a login, sign in, and search movies from a Google API. The user would not know this, but the finished product would be using GraphQL, rather than a normal RESTful website. The user will see a functioning login and signup prompt when they clock the link. The user would then be faced with an interface with a searchbar, where they can search for any popular movies. This developer is still working on the final deployment, but the final product will render the desired results.
